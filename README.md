Tetris
======

Coding challenge implementation of tetris, about 3 hours of recreational coding. Sadly, some identifiers are a little mangled since the code size restriction was 4096 bytes.

Check size (tested on Mac OS):

	cat tetris.coffee tetris.html | grep -v -E "^(\t|\s)*#" | wc -c

Try
---

You have to **click on the tetris canvas** due to jsfiddles framing. Try it at http://jsfiddle.net/henrikm85/b8cH4/embedded/result/
